# 🏙 NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on *data cleaning* and *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* of the *Airbnb New York City dataset (2019)*.  
The goal is to transform raw data into a cleaner and more reliable format, uncover meaningful insights, and lay the groundwork for future predictive modeling tasks such as price prediction and occupancy forecasting.

## ⚡ Key Steps  

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries.  
- Detected and removed unrealistic outliers (e.g., extreme prices, excessive minimum nights).  
- Ensured proper data types and dataset reliability.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyzed the *distribution of numerical variables* (price, minimum nights, reviews, availability).  
- Explored *categorical features* such as room types and neighborhood groups.  
- Investigated *host behavior and availability trends*.  
- Examined *price variations* across neighborhoods and room categories.  
- Conducted *correlation analysis* of numerical features.  
- Visualized *geospatial distribution* of listings across NYC.  

### 3. Insights & Future Work  
- Derived actionable insights for hosts, travelers, and policymakers.  
- Identified premium neighborhoods (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).  
- Highlighted host patterns (majority single-listing hosts, minority professional hosts).  
- Suggested directions for future work:  
  - Predictive modeling (price, occupancy).  
  - Advanced spatial & temporal trend analysis.  
  - Customer segmentation and market strategy optimization.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries  
- *Python* (Pandas, NumPy)  
- *Matplotlib, Seaborn* (Data Visualization)  
- *Jupyter Notebook*

## 📌 Results at a Glance  
- Manhattan dominates the market with the *highest average prices*.  
- Entire homes/apartments make up *over half of all listings*.  
- Most hosts own *only one listing*, while a few manage many.  
- Airbnb listings cluster heavily in central areas, especially *Manhattan and Brooklyn*.
